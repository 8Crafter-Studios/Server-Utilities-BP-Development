 * @param corner2 - The second corner of the area to regenerate.
 * @param dimension - The dimension in which the regeneration will take place.
 * @param radius - The radius around each block to consider for regeneration.
 * @param options - Optional parameters to customize the regeneration process.
 * @param options.minMSBetweenTickWaits - Minimum amount of time in milliseconds to spend regenerating the blocks each tick. Defaults to 2000.

 * @param options.airPriority - The amount to multiply by the weight of air. Defaults to 0.5.
 * @param options.ignoreNotYetGeneratedAir - If true, then surrounding air blocks that are in the section that has yet to be generated will not affect the type of blocks generated. Defaults to true.
 * @param options.randomization - The maximum amount by which to multiply or divide weights of the surrounding block permutations to randomize the generated block slightly. Defaults to 0.2.
 * @param options.doDistanceBasedPriority - Whether to prioritize surrounding blocks that are closer to the block being generated. Defaults to true.
